# Strategy Game

This project is to help familiarize myself with game developemnt in the Unity environment. Taking inspiration from games such as Fire Emblem and Into the Breach, I set out to create a simple tile based strategy game. My primary objective was to create a game filled with different characters with their own unique abilities. 


## Features In-progress:
- Units - Atleast 5 playable units, 3 can be selected in a game
- Tile diversity, e.g., mud lowers a unit's speed, lava kills a unit 
- Turns - Players can make a certain amount of "moves" each turn with their units, then the turn switches to the other 
- Unit Selection Screen 
- Update Graphics 

## Features Completed:
- Player

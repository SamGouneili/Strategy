# Strategy
A game I'm making to learn Unity!

This is a really simple tile based strategy game, similar to games like Fire Emblem. It was mostly inspired by a game called Into
The Breach, which I thought would be really fun to try to recreate with different abilities for the playable units, so that's what
I set out to do! Along with that, the project is mostly to really familiarize myself with game development via Unity, since it's the
first solo project on Unity that I've done. 

***Features I plan on adding:***
  - Units - Atleast 5 playable units, 3 can be selected in a game
  - Tiles - More tile variety, e.g., mud tiles which lower a unit's speed, lava tile which kills a unit when it's pushed into it 
  - Turns - Players can make a certain amount of "moves" each turn with their units, then the turn switches to the other player - ***Completed!***
  - Unit Selection Screen - Select the types of Units you want to use
  - Better Graphics - Updated graphics that aren't just squares
  - More tiles

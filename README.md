# Strategy
A game I'm making to learn Unity!

This is a really simple tile based strategy game, similar to games like Fire Emblem. It was mostly inspired by a game called Into
The Breach, which I thought would be really fun to try to recreate with different abilities for the playable units, so that's what
I set out to do! Along with that, the project is mostly to really familiarize myself with game development via Unity, since it's the
first solo project on Unity that I've done.
